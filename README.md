# Malaria-detection-alogorithm
 Building a machine learning model to detect malaria from cell images. Currently working on data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
Malaria Detection Using Machine Learning
Project Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect malaria from microscopic cell images. The goal is to assist in diagnosing malaria in a faster and more accurate manner using AI and image classification techniques.
Current Status

    In Progress: Data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation are ongoing.

    The project will include the development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification and will be optimized for real-world applications in medical diagnostics.

Technologies Used

    Python

    TensorFlow / Keras (for model building)

    OpenCV (for image processing)

    Matplotlib (for data visualization)

    Pandas / NumPy (for data manipulation)

Key Features

    Data Preprocessing: Image normalization and augmentation techniques to improve model performance.

    Model Building: CNN for image classification with a focus on achieving high accuracy.

    Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the modelâ€™s performance.
